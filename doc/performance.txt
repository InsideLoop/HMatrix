Test in between an array of structure and a structure of array for the
clustering part. Note that for the array of structure, the dimension is known at
compile time.
dim = 2
nb_nodes = 1000000
leaf_size = 10
nb_times = 100
Structure of array: 0.20s
Array of structure: 0.16s

So it is better to use an array of structure with dimension known at compile
time. It is expected as elements that are moved together are grouped together
in this kind of structure.
